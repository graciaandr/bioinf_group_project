    <h1>Welcome to SNPs Portal</h1>
    <p>The aim of the website is to provide researchers with a tool to investigate the effect of different evolutionary processes, 
        such as genetic drift and natural selection on genetic variation within population using Shannon Diversity index, Tajimaâ€™s D and Expected hHeterozygosity, 
        as well as, measure the genetic differentiation between populations indicated by the FST statistic. The output of results would depends on SNPs, 
        genes and chromosomal region of interest, and could be applied for human population genetic studies studying disease resistance.
